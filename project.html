      <p class="section-description">In the case of Cloud, I was the lead UI and UX designer for the project. I managed survey creation, competitive analysis, wire-frame development, prototyping, user/usability testing, as well as the mid and hi-fidelity mockup design.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2 class="problem-header">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="problem-description">The client presented an idea for a cloud storage application but did not have much in the way of clear details outside of a few aspects. With this vague idea, they asked that I help provide a clearer cut direction as I proceeded forward. The problem points that were presented to me were: to develop a specific list of features that would be needed to get the product to market, create a unique brand Identity, and create a visual representation of the app.</p>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2 class="solution-header">The Solution</h2>
      <img src="images/desktopfinal.png">
      <p class="solution-description">The aspect of design that fascinates me the most is that you’re communicating with someone, the user, about how to interact with an app or product. It’s taking a moment and saying “I think this is nice but does it translate to someone else?” being able to communicate with others is a trait I find highly valuable, and the ability to do so is practiced naturally.</p>

    <section class="process section green">
      <article class="survey-background">
          <h3 class="survey-header">Surveys</h3>
        <p class="survey-description">During the early part of the process I was dead set on making sure that the overwhelming majority of the decisions made concerning the design would be based on data gathered from potential users rather than going in blind. The most notable statistics were that 67% of potential users were between the ages of 26 and 35, 95% of potential users were most interested in  features such as uploading directly to from a desktop computer or mobile device, followed closely by the ability to organize folders tags via tags and categories. </p>
          <img src="images/how-old-are-you.png" class="how-old">
          <img src="images/options.png" class="options">
        <p class="survey-description">I had several features that the client were interested in adding, so part of the survey asked users if they might be interested in these particular features. 95% of users expressed interested in directly sharing files to another user, while 79% of users indicated that they were interested in real-time collaboration on documents. Of the users interested in real-time collaboration, I was surprised to find that 93% of them preferred to have digital sticky notes on documents to indicate changes made!</p>
          <img src="images/interest.png" class="interest">
        <p class="survey-description">The last two points were discerning what attracted them to the app that they already use, and how they prefer to login. 42% of users agreed that they prefer a simple app, as well as 21% would prefer to change from their current app because of a clunky User Interface. And of all users, 86% of users preferred to login via an email address. </p>

      <h2 class="competitive-section-header">Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p class="comp">Continuing in market research, I took a dive into three different competitors in order to dissect each of their interfaces in order to fine things that I liked, issues that I didn’t like, as well as options/routes to take to make my design stick out uniquely in the overcrowded storage market.</p>
      <article class="analysis blue">
        <h3 class="competitive-header">Boxdrive</h3>
          <img src="images/box-drive.png" class="box-drive">
            <p class="boxdrive-description">For Boxdrive, I had mostly negative impressions. Their branding was very inconsistent, some places on the web still refer to them as “Box,” which was their older brand name, and it’s splash page felt very crowded. More importantly, it shares many of the same elements of dropbox, from it’s primary colors to its name. So it’s brand identity didn’t feel very strong to me. It’s dashboard was very nice and simple, nothing harsh or hard to understand, so I did feel like there were elements I could take from it to benefit my own design.</p>
        <h3 class="competitive-header">Dropbox</h3>
          <img src="images/Drop-box.png" class="dropbox">
            <p class="dropbox-description">For Dropbox, the onboarding process was somewhat intrusive. As you scroll down the page, a window flies in from the right hand side and serves as a very hard contrast white making it particularly hard to look at. While most of the language describes how easy the app is to use, and how intuitive it can be, there’s very little in the way of describing how the company can keep your information safe and secure. While this is somewhat of a nitpick, in this day and age it feels like a missed opportunity to reassure users that they’ll be protected as well as have simple usability.</p>
        <h3 class="competitive-header">Evernote</h3>
          <img src="images/Evernote.png" class="evernote">
            <p class="evernote-description">This app was my favorite of the three as I felt it was the most unique. The logo with the elephant was a nice touch, and the color scheme consisted of more green variants with splashes of black. The biggest issue was that it remains one of the smallest among the crowd of storage apps, and it tends to be pushed to the wayside despite its unique branding.</p>

            <p class="user-descriptions">With the user stories process I referred back to the competitive analysis to understand more about what features each of them specifically shared and get a much better idea of features I would need as well. I broke each of the three levels down as follows:</p>

            <p class="mid">Mid = Features that are wanted and will be added</p>
